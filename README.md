# imgtoflex

## Claude Vision

This application uses the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model to understand and analyze images. Anthropic guidelines for image size, prompt recommendations, API implementation, and model limitations can be found [here](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/vision).

## How Run Initially

1. cd to /frontend directory & run `npm install`
2. cd to /backend directory & run `npm install`
3. run `npm run build:ui` (run when changes have been made to frontend)

### Note: Windows machines will need to install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) by running `wsl --install` in PowerShell or Windows Command and restart their machines in order to run Linux code.

4. run `node app.js` or `npm run dev` for dev environment
